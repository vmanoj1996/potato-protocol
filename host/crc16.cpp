// The CCITT CRC 16 polynomial is X + X + X + 1.
// In binary, this is the bit pattern 1 0001 0000 0010 0001, and in hex it
//  is 0x11021.
// A 17 bit register is simulated by testing the MSB before shifting
//  the data, which affords us the luxury of specifiy the polynomial as a
//  16 bit value, 0x1021.
